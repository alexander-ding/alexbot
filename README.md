## THIS BOT IS CURRENTLY DOWN, SINCE HEROKU IS KINDA EXPENSIVE :(

# Alex Bot

Alex Bot is a bot imitating my text style. It's made by scraping my own chat history with other people (hence the dataset is not made publically available). Check him out [here](http://alexding123.github.io/alexbot)

This is made largely following these tutorials:

1. [How I Used Deep Learning To Train A Chatbot To Talk Like Me (Sorta)](https://adeshpande3.github.io/How-I-Used-Deep-Learning-to-Train-a-Chatbot-to-Talk-Like-Me)
2. [Neural Machine Translation with Attention](https://www.tensorflow.org/beta/tutorials/text/nmt_with_attention)

The server is in another [repository](https://github.com/alexding123/alexbot-server), hosted on heroku.

## Getting Started

1. Install `npm` (comes with `node.js`)
2. `cd` into the project directory and run `npm install`
3. `npm start` to develop!
